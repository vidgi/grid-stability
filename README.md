# predicting grid stability with deep learning



### Integrating Renewable Energy into the Electric Grid
As renewable energy sources are increasingly adopted, an infrastructure of new paradigms is necessary to account for more production sources and the management of a much more flexible and complex system that can connect producers, consumers, and distribution.

Traditional operating ecosystems previously involved fewer energy sources that supply energy to consumers over unidirectional flows. However, with more renewable options, the end users now can consume energy and also have the ability to produce and supply it, yielding the new classification of 'prosumers'. Now, the energy flow within distribution grids, or 'smart grids' is bidirectional.

This increased flexibility due to renewable sources and 'prosumers' has led to the management of supply and demand to be far more complex and challenging, leading to many studies looking into methods of predicting and managing smart grid stability.

In this project, several prediction models are trained and compared in order to detect if the grid is stable/unstable.
